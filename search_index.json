I enrolled for the course in March of 2020 and I will provide the ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù moment of my journey. The program consists of 10 courses that covers the following: The Data Scientist‚Äôs Toolbox R Programming Getting and Cleaning Data Exploratory Data Analysis Reproducible Research Statistical Inference Regression Models Practical Machine Learning Developing Data Products Data Science Capstone As of today, July 29, 2020 I‚Äôm currently at course 10 Data Science Capstone - Week 1. The entire data science specialization can be completed in less than 11 months based on your desire to learn. I‚Äôve put in an average of 5 hours per day in each courses. The reason I wanted to learn these materials so fast are as follows: Personal growth Love dissecting data for insights The course syllabus is well though-out Professors bringing their expertise in their respective field Professors abilities to communicate and teach the courses is simple and concise. Professor Roger D. Peng, PhD, Professor Brian Caffo, PhD and Professor Jeff Leek, PhD - from the bottom of my heart - thank you so much. Expect To Have Lucid Dreams ‚ÄúI had a dream about you. It‚Äôs been a whilesince I could remember any of my dreams,and still, this one has left me with such strong impression.(Ninkovic 2020)‚Äù That quote from Aleksandra is one of the many stories that occurred to me while taking these courses. It is not easy. You need perseverance and continuously seeking knowledge. There were nights that turned to days and nights to day and back to night because I could not figure out how to solve a problem. My brain was constantly looking for a solution. Once you solved it, you then moved on to the next challenge with the same twist of time. It gets better üòÑ (???). There was no way for me to complete this program without the help of google.com, Yihue Xie, PhD - books, Professor Handley Wickham, PhD - books and to all the people that contributed to stackoverflow - Thank You. Retrospect If I could do it all over again. I would add the following courses, tools and skills on top of the specialization which are as follows: Get Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Desktop as your main environment (Canonical Team 2020). I initially started with Microsoft Windows 10. The experience was awful. After the Windows 10 update, it would not let me write on my disk while running RStudio. This added to the frustration and sleepless nights. Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is the most stable environment for me. Learn the bash through Cousera course The Unix Workbench by Sean Kross which provides a powerful insight of the inner working of linux accompanied with Git/Github for version control (Kross 2020). Learn blogdown or bookdown packages for proper documentation. There were many days that I have to find saved assignment in my hard-drive. These packages will organize your thought process and force you to have a central location. Now, that I have the power of blogdown/bookdown together with github, these provides a central place where I can organize my work and have a version control. These are very valuable tools to learn. Once complete your specialization using either bookdown or blogdown packages. I wish I can go back in-time and start the process with these 3 steps first before jumping into Data Science Specialization. References "],
["introduction.html", " 1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction It was March 2020, still traumatize that Andrew Yang drop-out from the presidential race. The only candidate that is data informed and very original. The other headline news during these time frame were about Syrian Civil War, Coronavirus pandemic, European migrant crisis, and the presidential race in the United States (Wikipedia 2020). I was very optimistic that United States will not have a pandemic in any of its states or properties. At the same time, I was amazed at the many dashboards that were created to monitor the spread of Covid-19 globally. Below is an example code of how easy to pull information and create your own dashboards and map visualization. library(COVID19) library(dplyr) library(DT) library(knitr) library(kableExtra) X &lt;- covid19() ## We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating COVID-19 Data Hub, please cite the following when using it: ## ## Guidotti, E., Ardia, D., (2020), &quot;COVID-19 Data Hub&quot;, Journal of Open ## Source Software 5(51):2376, doi: 10.21105/joss.02376. ## ## A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is ## ## @Article{, ## title = {COVID-19 Data Hub}, ## year = {2020}, ## doi = {10.21105/joss.02376}, ## author = {Emanuele Guidotti and David Ardia}, ## journal = {Journal of Open Source Software}, ## volume = {5}, ## number = {51}, ## pages = {2376}, ## } ## ## To retrieve citation and metadata of the data sources see ?covid19cite.

These numbers are peoples families, love ones or neighbors and our lives have forever change. Map visualization can be accomplish with many packages available in R. One of them is called leaflet package and below will show us how aggressive the spread of Covid19 through out the globe during the end of March 2020. View Code library(leaflet) library(viridisLite) library(viridis) mapVisData &lt;- X %&gt;% filter(date == &quot;2020-03-31&quot;) %&gt;% rename(country=administrative_area_level_1) %&gt;% select(country, date, longitude, latitude, confirmed, recovered, deaths) CountryColor &lt;- colorFactor(viridis(76), mapVisData$country) map1 &lt;- leaflet(data = mapVisData) %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% setView(lng = 26.8206, lat = 30.8025, zoom = 2) %&gt;% addCircleMarkers( ~ longitude, ~ latitude, popup = paste( &quot;Country: &quot;,prettyNum(mapVisData$country, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;, &quot;Confirmed: &quot;,prettyNum(mapVisData$confirmed, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;, &quot;Recovered: &quot;, prettyNum(mapVisData$recovered, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;, &quot;Deaths: &quot;, prettyNum(mapVisData$deaths, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;)), weight = 1, radius = ~ sqrt(confirmed)*.1, stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = .7, fillColor = ~CountryColor(country) ) map1 Figure 1.1: (RStudio Leaflet Team 2020) At the beginning of the class, I was not able to code the way I code in R now. The progression and knowledge skills increase as I consume more of the information. Again, I had vivid dreams while taking these classes and if you decided to pursue the same route, may you have sweetest of all dreams. References "],
