["data-science-toolbox.html", " 2 Data Science Toolbox", " 2 Data Science Toolbox The Data Science Toolbox provides a basic foundation in creating a work environment as a data scientist. This environment is based on the R language. It is an environment for statistical computing, graphics and so much more. It is similar to the S language developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and his team (The R Foundation 2020). R language is created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand and is developed by the R Development Core Team. Thus, R is named after the first initials of the co-creators Ross &amp; Robert (Wikipedia 2019). References "],
["more-than-a-statistical-language.html", "2.1 More Than a Statistical Language", " 2.1 More Than a Statistical Language R language is use in many industries such as research in academia, pharmaceutical for clinical trials, finance for risk management, social media for natural language processing and sentiment analysis, manufacturing for predicting demand and market trends and many more. Below is an example of a reproducible expression in building a simple metric stock analysis in R combined with shiny.

Visualization amplifies messages and at the same time simplifies communication to an audience. Visualization provides an insight to make better decision. Figure 2.3 and 2.4 shows a bi-modal distribution. There are two groups of traders in these charts. The first group bought and sold at around 7 and the other one at 13. There are many variables that we do not see in these two charts such as date and time, current news, trade environment and many more which falls under standard error. The goal is to minimize the se. Lets create another chart comparing the movement of NIO and SPY and see if there is a relationship by creating an imaginary investment of 100 dollars each on NIO and SPY with a starting date of 01-01-2019. Let’s look at the code # clear everything rm(list = ls()) # ticker symbols ticker &lt;- c(&quot;NIO&quot;, &quot;SPY&quot;) # Grab Data using tidyquant package StockData &lt;- tq_get(ticker, from = &quot;2019-01-01&quot;) # initial investment of 100 NIO &lt;- StockData %&gt;% filter(symbol ==&quot;NIO&quot;) %&gt;% select(symbol, date, close) %&gt;% mutate(init=100*close[[1]], actual = close*100, ratio =round(((actual/init)-1)*100, digits=3)) NIO[1:6,] %&gt;% kable(caption = &quot;NIO $100 Investment&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() Table 2.2: NIO $100 Investment symbol date close init actual ratio NIO 2019-01-02 6.20 620 620 0.000 NIO 2019-01-03 6.05 620 605 -2.419 NIO 2019-01-04 6.36 620 636 2.581 NIO 2019-01-07 6.50 620 650 4.839 NIO 2019-01-08 6.40 620 640 3.226 NIO 2019-01-09 6.63 620 663 6.935 SPY &lt;- StockData %&gt;% filter(symbol ==&quot;SPY&quot;) %&gt;% select(symbol, date, close) %&gt;% mutate(init=100*close[[1]], actual = close*100, ratio =round(((actual/init)-1)*100, digits=3)) SPY[1:6,] %&gt;% kable(caption = &quot;SPY $100 Investment&quot;) %&gt;% kable_styling() Table 2.3: SPY $100 Investment symbol date close init actual ratio SPY 2019-01-02 250.18 25018 25018 0.000 SPY 2019-01-03 244.21 25018 24421 -2.386 SPY 2019-01-04 252.39 25018 25239 0.883 SPY 2019-01-07 254.38 25018 25438 1.679 SPY 2019-01-08 256.77 25018 25677 2.634 SPY 2019-01-09 257.97 25018 25797 3.114 # Data Wrangling NIO &lt;- NIO %&gt;% filter(symbol == &quot;NIO&quot;) %&gt;% select(symbol, date, ratio) %&gt;% rename(NIO = ratio) SPY &lt;- SPY %&gt;% filter(symbol == &quot;SPY&quot;) %&gt;% select(symbol, date, ratio) %&gt;% rename(SPY = ratio) # Combining data frame StockData &lt;- left_join(NIO, SPY, by=&quot;date&quot;) %&gt;% select(date, NIO, SPY) NIO_h &lt;- StockData %&gt;% filter(NIO &gt; 100) SPy_h &lt;-StockData %&gt;% filter(SPY&gt; 30) ggplot(StockData, aes(x=NIO, y=SPY),color=&quot;grey&quot;)+ geom_point(alpha=.5)+ geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;)+ labs(title = &quot;Percentage Gain&quot;)+ geom_point(data = NIO_h, aes(x=NIO, y=SPY), color = &quot;red&quot;, alpha = .3)+ geom_point(data = SPy_h, aes(x=NIO, y=SPY), color = &quot;blue&quot;,alpha = .3) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Figure 2.5: Beta We can see from figure 2.5 that the blue line is almost horizontal with a slightly positive relationship and close to zero - meaning no relationship. The correlation between NIO and SPY is 0.1005324, which again is close to zero. Once we combine all of these graphs. We can create a dashboard using Shiny. Click to see.
