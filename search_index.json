["data-science-toolbox.html", " 2 Data Science Toolbox", " 2 Data Science Toolbox The Data Science Toolbox provides a basic foundation in creating a work environment as a data scientist. This environment is based on the R language. It is an environment for statistical computing and graphics and so much more. It is similar to the S language developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and his team (The R Foundation 2020). R language is created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand and is developed by the R Development Core Team. Thus, R is named after the first initials of the co-creators Ross &amp; Robert (Wikipedia 2019). References "],

Visualization amplifies your messaging and simplifies communication to an audience. Visualization provides an insight to make better decision. We can see from figure 2.3 and 2.4 that the data is bi-modal. There are two groups of buyers here. The first group bought it at around 7 and the other one at 13. There are many factors that we do not see in these two charts such as date and time, current news, trade environment and many more. This are just some of the tools that R can provide. Lets create another chart comparing the movement of NIO and SPY and see if there is a relationship. Let’s also invest 100 dollars and see the difference between the two tickers. The date is set on 01-01-2019.

The correlation between NIO and SPY is 0.0873183 which again, close to zero. Once we combine all of these graphs. We can create a dashboard using Shiny. Click to see "],
