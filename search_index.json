I‚Äôm a consultant that uses many forms of technology to analyze data such as Power BI, Tableau, Salesforce, Looker and R. I wanted to share with you my experience in improving my skill sets in data analytics around R language environment. This is a journey of sleepless nights during Covid-19 lockdown and how I was able to learn R programming through Coursera - JHU Data Science Specialization (Johns Hopkins University 2020). I enrolled for the course in March of 2020 and I will summarize a tidy format of my notes during these specialization. The program consists of 10 courses that covers the following: The Data Scientist‚Äôs Toolbox R Programming Getting and Cleaning Data Exploratory Data Analysis Reproducible Research Statistical Inference Regression Models Practical Machine Learning Developing Data Products Data Science Capstone As of today, July 29, 2020 I‚Äôm currently at course 10 Data Science Capstone - Week 1. The entire data science specialization can be completed in less than 11 months based on your desire to learn. I‚Äôve put in an average of 5 hours per day in each courses. The reason I wanted to learn these materials so fast are as follows: Personal growth Love dissecting data for insights The course syllabus is well thought-out Professors‚Äô expertise in their respective field and abilities to communicate and teach the courses in a simple and concise manner. Professor Roger D. Peng, PhD, Professor Brian Caffo, PhD and Professor Jeff Leek, PhD - from the bottom of my heart - thank you so much. References "],

It‚Äôs been a whilesince I could remember any of my dreams,and still, this one has left me with such strong impression.(Ninkovic 2020)‚Äù That quote from Aleksandra is one of the many stories that occurred to me while taking these courses. It is not easy. You need perseverance and continuously seeking knowledge. There were nights that turned to days and nights to day and back to night because I could not figure out how to solve a problem. My brain was constantly looking for a solution. Once you solved it, you then moved on to the next challenge with the same twist of time. It gets better üòÑ (???). There was no way for me to complete this program without the help of google.com, Yihue Xie, PhD - books, Professor Handley Wickham, PhD - books and to all the people that contributed to stackoverflow - Thank You.

The number one reason I created a bookdown of my experiences in R is to thank the community that help me get here. To have a center place for most of the code that I use on a daily basis. I hope people find this book helpful without losing sleep. "],
["in-retrospect.html", "In Retrospect", " In Retrospect If I could do it all over again. I would add the following courses, tools and skills on top of the specialization which are as follows: Get Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Desktop as your main environment (Canonical Team 2020). I initially started with Microsoft Windows 10. The experience was awful. After the Windows 10 update, it would not let me write on my disk while running RStudio. This added to the frustration and sleepless nights. Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is the most stable environment for me. Learn the bash through Cousera course The Unix Workbench by Sean Kross which provides a powerful insight of the inner working of linux accompanied with Git/Github for version control (Kross 2020). Learn blogdown or bookdown packages for proper documentation. There were many days that I have to find saved assignment in my hard-drive. These packages will organize your thought process and force you to have a central location. Now, that I have the power of blogdown/bookdown together with github, these provides a central place where I can organize my work and have a version control. These are very valuable tools to learn. Once complete your specialization using either bookdown or blogdown packages. I wish I can go back in-time and start the process with these 3 steps first before jumping into Data Science Specialization. References "]
