["intro.html", " 1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction It was March 2020, still traumatize that Andrew Yang drop-out from the presidential race. The only candidate that is data informed and very original. The other headline news during these time frame were about Syrian Civil War, Coronavirus pandemic, European migrant crisis, and the presidential race in the United States (Wikipedia 2020). I was very optimistic that United States will not have a pandemic in any of its states or properties. At the same time, I was amazed at the many dashboards that were created to monitor the spread of Covid-19 globally. Below is an example code of how easy to pull information and create your own dashboards and map visualization. library(COVID19) library(dplyr) library(DT) library(knitr) library(kableExtra) X &lt;- covid19() MarchCovid &lt;- X %&gt;% filter(date == &quot;2020-03-31&quot;) %&gt;% select( administrative_area_level_1, date, confirmed, recovered, deaths ) %&gt;% arrange(desc(confirmed)) %&gt;% rename(country = administrative_area_level_1) MarchCovid[1:10, ] %&gt;% kable(caption = &#39;March 2020 Covid19 Metrics&#39;) %&gt;% kable_styling() Table 1.1: March 2020 Covid19 Metrics id country date confirmed recovered deaths USA United States 2020-03-31 188724 7024 5605 ITA Italy 2020-03-31 105792 15729 12428 ESP Spain 2020-03-31 95923 19259 8464 CHN China 2020-03-31 82545 0 3314 DEU Germany 2020-03-31 60618 58437 2181 FRA France 2020-03-31 52128 9444 3523 IRN Iran 2020-03-31 44605 14656 2898 GBR United Kingdom 2020-03-31 38484 135 2426 BEL Belgium 2020-03-31 16982 1696 1305 CHE Switzerland 2020-03-31 16605 1823 433 I started the Data Science Specialization when Covid-19 cases were below 200,000 in the US. These numbers are peoples families, love ones or neighbors and our lives have forever change. Map visualization can be accomplish with many packages available in R. One of them is called leaflet package and below will show us how aggressive the spread of Covid19 through out the globe during the end of March 2020. View Code library(leaflet) library(viridisLite) library(viridis) mapVisData &lt;- X %&gt;% filter(date == &quot;2020-03-31&quot;) %&gt;% rename(country=administrative_area_level_1) %&gt;% select(country, date, longitude, latitude, confirmed, recovered, deaths) CountryColor &lt;- colorFactor(viridis(76), mapVisData$country) map1 &lt;- leaflet(data = mapVisData) %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% setView(lng = 26.8206, lat = 30.8025, zoom = 2) %&gt;% addCircleMarkers( ~ longitude, ~ latitude, popup = paste( &quot;Country: &quot;,prettyNum(mapVisData$country, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;, &quot;Confirmed: &quot;,prettyNum(mapVisData$confirmed, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;, &quot;Recovered: &quot;, prettyNum(mapVisData$recovered, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;, &quot;Deaths: &quot;, prettyNum(mapVisData$deaths, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;)), weight = 1, radius = ~ sqrt(confirmed)*.1, stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = .7, fillColor = ~CountryColor(country) ) map1 Figure 1.1: (RStudio Leaflet Team 2020) At the beginning of the class, I was not able to code the way I code in R now. The progression and knowledge skills increase as I consume more of the information. Again, I had vivid dreams while taking these classes and if you decided to pursue the same route, may you have sweetest of all dreams. References "]
