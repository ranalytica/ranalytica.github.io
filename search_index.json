The Data Science Toolbox provides a basic foundation in creating a work environment as a data scientist. This environment is based on the R language. It is an environment for statistical computing and graphics and so much more. It is similar to the S language developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and his team (The R Foundation 2020). R language is created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand and is developed by the R Development Core Team. Thus, R is named after the first initials of the co-creators Ross &amp; Robert (Wikipedia 2020b). R2 sounds better. References "],
